💎 GLOBAL WALLET ULTIMATE (V23.0)
Executive Wealth Management & Autonomous Passive Income Protocol
🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW
A high-fidelity Fintech ecosystem built for Sovereign Wealth Tracking and Automated Network Growth. This project is engineered with a Revenue-First reward logic, ensuring total business dignity and net profit protection for the Admin.
🧠 MANDATORY BUSINESS LOGIC (DNA)
1. The "Smart Valve" Reward System
Revenue-Locked: Rewards are ₹0 for free signups. Referral payouts are triggered ONLY when a user activates their account via the Paid Subscription Fee.
Tier-1 (Direct): Automatic reward to the person(premium/upgraded) who shared the code.
Tier-2 (Passive): Payout to the "Grandparent."
The Performance Lock: Tier-2 rewards are LOCKED every cycle. To unlock, a user must be Premium AND have at least 1 Direct Paid Referral in the current_cycle_id.
Admin Profit: Rewards from "Lazy Users" (those who failed to refer in the current cycle) stay with the Admin as net profit.
2. Identity & Security Protocol
Identity: All accounts are tied to +91 concatenated mobile numbers.
Auth: Strictly 4-Digit PIN for layman accessibility.
The Vault: Every user receives a 6-Digit Non-Recoverable Recovery Key at signup.
Self-Service Recovery: Users reset their own PIN via Mobile + Recovery Key. Admin intervention is 0%.
🎨 UI/UX DESIGN SYSTEM (DIGNITY GUARD)
Theme: "Executive Wealth" - Deep Navy (#0A192F), Wealth Gold (#FFD700), and Glassmorphism.
Safe-Area Elevation: All interactive docks are elevated (bottom + 90px) to prevent inter-mixing with Android physical navigation buttons.
Dual-Wallet Hub:
Green Card: Real-time Withdrawable Passive Income.
Red Card: Dynamic Expense Ledger Sum (Today/Week/Month/Custom).
Dual-Input Engine: side-by-side Gold Mic (Voice-AI) and Keyboard (Manual) icons.
🎙️ HIGH-TECH FEATURES
Voice-AI Entry: Multi-language (Hindi/English) support. Auto-parses "Amount + Category" (e.g., "Chai 20"

 Food Category).
Dignity Ledger: Every entry contains Sr No (#), Category, Specific Note, and Timestamp.
Simultaneous Sync: Adding, Editing, or Deleting an entry updates the Ledger Sum and Wallet Balance instantly.
Executive Reporting: Premium users can share a perfectly formatted text summary of their ledger to WhatsApp.
🕹️ ADMIN GOD-MODE HUB
Visible only to is_admin: true.
Remote UI Control: Live editing of Brand Name, Fee, Rewards, and Cycle ID.
Intelligence P&L: Real-time math: (Premium Users * Fee) - (Paid Rewards) = Net Profit.
User Audit: Master list for export/printing of all user profiles and balances.
🛠️ TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Frontend: React Native (Expo)
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Deployment: Expo EAS (Android APK)
Path Protocol: Relative paths (./) enforced for APK stability.
The Icon Vaccine: Hard-coded Font.loadAsync to prevent "Box Icons" on mobile.
🏗️ BUILD & DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS
To generate a new Sovereign APK:
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build -p android --profile preview
Architect's Note: This build is finalized and 'OK Tested' for immediate production deployment. The treasury net profit is locked against liability risks.
This README is my best friend :-
Logic Preservation: It reminds the AI (and humans) that Tier-2 rewards have a Performance Lock.
Safety: It clearly lists the 4-digit PIN and Relative Path rules so no one breaks the APK again.
Dignity: It defines the Gold/Navy theme as the project standard.
